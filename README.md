# Crossed Wires
Crossed Wires is an in-development cube rails prototype.

It is an economic, network-building game. Players are investors in competing wireless infrastructure companies. To fund operations, players issue shares, enabling companies to expand their network, secure access to new areas by building towers, and generate payouts by expanding to cities. As networks grow in value, so do the value of the companies' shares. However, this comes with risk as issuing shares dilutes initial equity and creates openings for opportunistic cross-investors seeking to funnel that money into their own pockets via leasing rival companies' infrastructures. 

This repo's mostly for personal use, but if anyone stumbles on it and has thoughts/questions/feedback/thinks it trash, hit me up.
